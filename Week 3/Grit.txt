Grit

I've encountered a lot of difficulty in my life, and I have no doubts that my grit is what got me through most of my childhood. As a teenager I faced a lot of mental and social issues that made school a very hostile environment for me, however I managed to make it through every day by doing my best in the moment and telling myself "tomorrow is a new day". I've found in adulthood a lot of things people call "difficult" are not so challenging in the task itself, but through the arduous process of doing the task, "jumping through hoops" as my mom would say. Changing your mindset to doing a little everyday in contrast to doing a bunch in one sitting is a great way to break up the work and make it less overwhelming in your mind.
