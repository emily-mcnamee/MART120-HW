The GUI and CLI are interfaces that allow you to interact with your computer's system, the difference being how you interact with the interfaces. The GUI interface uses icon and menus to delve into the computer systems, such as using File Explorer and clicking on folder graphics and words such as "Documents". The CLI interfact uses interfaces such as Command Prompt to enter commands using text, or prompts. Examples of this is C:\Users\jazzo\Documents>dir , which would show the directory of the file Documents within the user of "jazzo" in a computer.
