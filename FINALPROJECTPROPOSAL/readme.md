For my final project, I would like to create an "animated" visualization of what's called a "biblically accurate" Throne; I was inspired by the example from Steven Round's Visualization final shown in the course website, and  3D artist  Jonas Pfeiffer's (@jopfe on instagram) animated series "Celestial Beings"

This project will be focusing mainly on the 3D animation aspect of p5, using WEBGL
This projct will be using 3D animations and shapes such as spheres and toruses. There will also be animation of ellipses, and use of arrays.

As shown in the very rough sketch included in this proposal, the project will have a sphere in the center, with multiple toruses encircling the middle, along with perhaps ringed arrays of ellipses. These will act as the rings of gold and eyes that "biblically accurate thrones" are portrayed to have; the ellipses will be drawn to appear as eyes, and the toruses will be drawn as gold rings, some toruses may also have a layer of ellipses on top of them to give off the impression of a literal ring of eyes. 

The center sphere will be a large human eye, the iris moving around. The sphere may be animated to drift up and down, as long as the torus and arrays can be animated to move along with it. 

I would also like to add four wing-like structures to the piece, either added in as drawn images through photoshop or drawn in p5.js. They will also be animated to move with the center sphere.

There will be use of the WEBGL code for camera(), translate(), perspective(), ambientLight(), pointLight(), specularMaterial(), torus(), and sphere()

I am already in the process of learning WEBGL through multiple tutorials on youtube
