    <h1>I play a lot of video games!</h1>
    <br>
    I play a wide range of genres, but here's a few of my favorites:
    <br>
    <h2>Crusader Kings 3</h2>
    <p>This is a historical empire builder! I especially enjoy playing the Norse culture and going on viking adventures :> </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Stardew Valley</h2>
    <p>It's a farming simulator! You get to build a farm, go adventuring in the mines, and make friends with the villagers!</p>
    <p> love love this game! Anytime I feel too stressed, a Stardew sesh is exactly what the doctor ordered. I have over 500 hours in it!</p>

    <br>
    <h2 style="color:red">Cult of the Lamb</h2>
    <p>This is a new obscession of mine! It's a rogue-like with additional gameplay where you grow your cult of cute animals! All hail the One Who Waits!</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Legend of Zelda: The WindWaker</h2>
    <p>This was my childhood game, and it's never left my brain since! I started drawing because of this game, and thus my current art style is heavily inspired by this game.</p>
    <p>This was also my very first Zelda game, so even though I've played most of the series by now, it holds a special place my heart</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Cookie Run: Kingdom</h2>
    <p>An adorable app game about living cookies! I always spend at least an hour a day taking care of my kingdom! The art and voice acting is amazing!</p>
