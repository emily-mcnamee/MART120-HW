You are a Visual learner! 

I am pretty aware that I'm a visual learner first and foremost. Although not fit for all situations, I always want to learn from someone who knows the material firstmost before I try to do it myself, just to be sure that I'm doing the task correctly. I always look up videos to visually aiid me in doing things I am not failiar with. Seeing someone do it correctly helps me feel confident in doing it myself.
