For one, I was perplexed by Randy Pausch’s sincerely happy attitude during this entire talk, despite recently being given six months to live. 
Even after watching the entire talk, and learning about all of the adventures Randy has gone through, I feel like I would personally struggle with that information looming over my every day. 
Although, Randy come across as a man who views the glass half full; it does make this talk feel a lot more emotional, like you’re watching a man deconstruct the meaning of his life in front of an audience. 
Randy’s talk was one of spreading creativity and positivity into the world, which I found endearing. 

The "Brick wall" idea is actually a very good way of looking at things, I feel. It reminds me of the saying "You fail 100% of the times you don't try". A lot of anxiety is surrounded by the fear of rejection, however
you cannot learn what works without first experiencing what doesn't work. 

I did connect a lot with his message to never let your creativity die out, and to embrace your childhood dreams. 
I don't really remember having many "bucketlist dreams" as a kid, but I feel that my child self would be blown away with what I'm trying to create for myself now. I always wanted to become an artist but felt that it was an impossible goal,
deciding to follow the path of art was a large leap for me that I don't regret taking. I feel even if I don't become the world-reknown artist I once imagined, the art career I manage to create for myself will be just as fullfilling.
