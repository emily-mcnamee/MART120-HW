    <h1>I play a lot of video games!</h1>>
    <br>
    I play a wide range of genres, but here's a few of my favorites:
    <br>
    Crusader Kings 3
    This is a historical empire builder! I especially enjoy playing the Norse culture and going on viking adventures :>
    <br>
    Stardew Valley
    It's a farming simulator! You get to build a farm, go adventuring in the mines, and make friends with the villagers!
    I love love this game! Anytime I feel too stressed, a Stardew sesh is exactly what the doctor ordered. I have over 500 hours in it!
    <br>
    Cult of the Lamb
    This is a new obscession of mine! It's a rogue-like with additional gameplay where you grow your cult of cute animals! All hail the One Who Waits!
